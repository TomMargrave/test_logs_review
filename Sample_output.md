Thanks — I parsed **/mnt/data/test_log_all.log** and analyzed every release block. (Source: uploaded log file.) 

Below is a concise, actionable QA-style report that matches your requested output format.

# Key findings (quick top-level)

* No step failures reported in any release: all releases show **Steps Failed: 0** in the log summaries. 
* Tests and test-sets vary across releases (many tests are present in some releases but not others) — several tests are *flaky/missing* between releases (listed below).
* Average **per-test** total latency (computed from the logs) shows small but measurable variation across releases:

  * R1.0 — **6,643 ms** average total per test. 
  * R2.0 — **6,339 ms** (Δ vs R1: **-304 ms**, ~-4.6%). 
  * R3.0 — **6,452 ms** (Δ vs R2: **+113 ms**). 
  * R3.1 — **6,339 ms** (Δ vs R3.0: **-113 ms**). 
  * R5.0 — **6,543 ms** (Δ vs R3.1: **+204 ms**). 

(Notes: the log file also contains release statement “Average Latency” values in the raw summaries — I used the per-test totals from each release to compute the averages & deltas above to match your requested analysis.)

# 2) Failed or flaky tests (appearance / disappearance)

**No test steps failed** (Steps Failed reported = 0 in each release summary). 

**Flaky / inconsistent presence across releases** (tests that appear in *some* releases but not all — likely candidate for investigation):

* Test_10 — appears in R2.0, R3.0, R3.1, R5.0 (missing R1.0).
* Test_16 — appears in R1.0, R3.0, R3.1, R5.0 (missing R2.0).
* Test_6  — appears in R1.0, R3.1, R5.0 (missing in others).
* Test_17 — present in R1.0, R2.0, R5.0 (skipped in R3.0/R3.1).
* Test_4  — present in R1.0, R3.0, R3.1, R5.0.
* Transfer_Funds — present in R1.0, R3.0, R3.1, R5.0 but **absent in R2.0**.
* Test_7 — only in R2.0 and R3.0.
* Test_5 — present starting R3.0, persists in R3.1 and R5.0.
* Test_13 — present in R2.0 and R3.0 only.
* Test_15 — present in R2.0, R3.0, R3.1, R5.0.

**Interpretation:** many test IDs are added/removed between releases (expected during test-suite churn), but anything intended to be a stable smoke/regression test that disappears from a release should be flagged. Transfer_Funds being missing in R2.0 is a notable example.

# 3) Performance regressions, latency trends, outliers & medians

**Global trend (per-test totals):**

* R1.0 → R2.0: overall improvement (~304 ms reduction).
* R2.0 → R3.0: slight regression (~+113 ms).
* R3.0 → R3.1: slight improvement (~-113 ms).
* R3.1 → R5.0: regression (~+204 ms).
  So performance fluctuates between minor gains and regressions; **R5.0** shows the largest recent regression vs prior stable run (R3.1).

**Top 3 slowest tests (overall average total across releases):**

1. **Login_And_Checking_Balance** — ~**10,551 ms** average total across releases (dominates due to a 4,000 ms "Get Checking balance" backend step each run).
2. **Transfer_Funds** — ~**9,449 ms** average total.
3. **Test_17** — ~**6,169 ms** average total.

(These are the tests contributing most to test-suite wall-time — prime targets for profiling/parallelization or test redesign.) 

**Most stable tests (smallest latency variation across releases):**

* **Test_7** (very consistent when present)
* **Test_17**
* **Test_9**

(“Stable” = low standard deviation of per-test total latency across releases where they appear.)

**Outliers (per-step & per-test):**

* Steps named **Get Checking balance** always show **4000 ms** — a consistent large backend call. That single step is the largest contributor to test totals (sum across releases = ~20,000 ms). 
* Some releases show spikes in page-load / verify-home times (e.g., R5.0 has longer Verify home page times: 1,190ms in the Login test vs earlier 854–1,089ms in prior releases), and Click Login button spikes in R2.0 and R5.0 (example values in logs). 

**Median and average step latencies (per-step):**

* Average per-step latency (across all steps and releases) is ~**570–582 ms** depending on release; medians are close (~530–540 ms), indicating a roughly right-skewed distribution driven by a few large steps (the ~4,000 ms query steps). (These stats were computed from the uploaded logs.)

# 4) Global analysis (variation, step-type dominance, suspicious patterns)

**Which tests show most variation in latency?**

* Tests with the largest total-delta across releases include:

  * **Login_And_Checking_Balance** (notable spikes in some releases)
  * **Transfer_Funds** (varies across runs)
  * **Test_17** (some variation but more stable than Login/Transfer)
    These are the highest-impact variability sources.

**Which step types dominate total run time?** (sum of latencies across all releases)

* **Verify** (verify page / home / result checks) — large share.
* **Other** (misc. steps named outside the canonical categories) — also large.
* **Actions** (Select/Perform/Submit) — large contributor.
* **Logout** and **Login** steps are non-trivial but smaller than the above.
* **Backend/Query** (the “Get Checking balance” 4,000 ms step) — **single biggest per-step item**; aggregated backend query time equals ~20,000 ms across releases (i.e., five runs × 4,000 ms), making it a dominant single-point contributor to test time.
  Aggregate numbers (sum of latencies by type, approximated from the logs): Verify ≈ 88k ms, Other ≈ 86k ms, Action ≈ 86.7k ms, Logout ≈ 83k ms, Login ≈ 74.5k ms, Backend/Query ≈ 20k ms. (Rounded approximate sums computed from the logs.)

**Suspicious repetition / skipped patterns**

* Several tests are *skipped* in each release (summary shows some tests skipped: e.g., R1: Skipped 5; R2: Skipped 5; R3: Skipped 2; R3.1: Skipped 3; R5: Skipped 2). If those skipped tests are meant to be stable smoke tests, that’s suspicious. Otherwise, it may reflect intentional selective execution. 
* Some repeated steps appear (e.g., multiple "Verify logged out" or multiple "Click Log out" entries per test) — this sometimes appears twice in the same test run. If intentional (double-checking), consider collapsing to one authoritative check; if accidental, it indicates duplicated test actions.

---

# 5) Actionable recommendations (testing process & app-under-test)

**A. Test-suite / process improvements**

1. **Mark slow backend calls and isolate them**: the **Get Checking balance** backend call (4,000 ms) dominates run time. Consider:

   * Mocking or stubbing that call for the UI-level test (if you want fast feedback).
   * Or separate it into a dedicated performance test so functional UI runs don’t pay the full backend latency cost.
2. **Stabilize/standardize canonical smoke tests across releases**: decide on a baseline set of tests that must run every release (e.g., Login, Transfer_Funds, essential flows). Make sure they are not removed between releases unless intentionally replaced. Transfer_Funds missing in R2.0 is an example to investigate.
3. **Parallelize long-running tests** where possible — run heavy tests (those containing long backend queries) on dedicated nodes or in parallel to reduce wall-clock test time.
4. **Reduce duplicated verification steps** within tests (e.g., repeated 'Verify logged out') — collapse to one check or move duplicates into a dedicated end-of-test verification.
5. **Introduce per-step thresholds / alerts**: set warning thresholds (e.g., Login > 900ms, Verify home > 1,000ms, Backend query > 2000ms) and fail the build or open a ticket when exceeded.

**B. App-under-test / dev recommendations**

1. **Investigate backend latency for balance query** — 4,000 ms per call is high for an interactive flow. If real backend work is required, consider:

   * Caching, async loading, or server-side performance improvements.
   * Returning a placeholder quickly and loading balance lazily after page load.
2. **Profile the “Verify home page appeared” and “Click Login” spikes** in R5.0 (and earlier spikes in R2.0): these are user-perceived delays; correlate with server logs & deployment differences between releases.
3. **Track regressions to releases**: whenever average test total per-test increases by >2–3% vs baseline, open a perf triage. R5.0 shows ~+204 ms vs R3.1 (≈ +3.2%) — worth triage.

## Table of releases with key metrics

(See the table above under section **Parsed summary per release** — repeated here as compressed list)

* R1.0: Tests 12 | Passed 12 | Skipped 5 | Avg total/test 6643 ms. 
* R2.0: Tests 12 | Passed 12 | Skipped 5 | Avg total/test 6339 ms. 
* R3.0: Tests 15 | Passed 15 | Skipped 2 | Avg total/test 6452 ms. 
* R3.1: Tests 14 | Passed 14 | Skipped 3 | Avg total/test 6339 ms. 
* R5.0: Tests 15 | Passed 15 | Skipped 2 | Avg total/test 6543 ms. 

## Top 3 slowest tests (overall avg total)

1. **Login_And_Checking_Balance** — ~10,551 ms average (dominated by 4s balance query). 
2. **Transfer_Funds** — ~9,449 ms average. 
3. **Test_17** — ~6,169 ms average.

## Top 3 most stable tests (least variation)

1. **Test_7**
2. **Test_17**
3. **Test_9**

## List of failed or flaky tests

* **Failed tests:** none (no failed step entries; Steps Failed = 0 for every release). 
* **Flaky (presence inconsistent across releases):** Test_10, Test_16, Test_6, Test_17, Test_4, Transfer_Funds, Test_7, Test_5, Test_13, Test_15 (see notes above).

## Observed performance trend summary

* The per-test average total shows **small oscillations**: an improvement from R1 → R2, then slight regressions and another improvement, but **R5.0** exhibits a notable increase vs its immediate predecessor (R3.1) — **this is where I’d triage performance**.
* The single biggest contributor to runtime is the repeated **Get Checking balance** backend call (4,000 ms) — neutralizing or mocking this call would give the largest test runtime reduction.

# AI QA Analyst Summary (short paragraph)

Overall the suite is functionally stable (no failing steps reported) but shows churn in which tests run between releases and modest performance fluctuation. The single largest test-time consumer is the 4,000 ms balance retrieval step — isolate or mock it for fast feedback loops, and standardize a stable subset of smoke tests to run every release so you can reliably detect regressions. R5.0 shows the largest recent latency regression and should be triaged focusing on login / verify-home and backend query timings.
